# Pipelined-AMD-Ryzen-9
This is a simple pipelined processor that serves as the project for the Computer Architecture course (CMP 3010) taught at Cairo University.


## Implemented Instructions
### ‚òùÔ∏è One Operand
```
NOP
HLT
SETC
NOT Rdst
INC Rdst
OUT Rdst
IN Rdst
```
### ‚úåÔ∏è Two Operands
```
MOV Rsrc, Rdst
ADD Rdst, Rsrc1, Rsrc2
SUB  Rdst, Rsrc1, Rsrc2
AND  Rdst, Rsrc1, Rsrc2
IADD Rdst, Rsrc2 ,Imm
```

### üíæ Memory
```
PUSH  Rdst
POP  Rdst
LDM  Rdst, Imm
LDD  Rdst, offset(Rsrc)
STD Rsrc1, offset(Rsrc2)
```

### ü¶ò Jumps
```
